## Project Quick Reference
### Progressive Web App
Progressive web apps could be the next big thing for the mobile web. Originally proposed by Google in 2015, they have already attracted a lot of attention because of the relative ease of development and the almost instant wins for the applicationâ€™s user experience. 
>Think of it as a website built using web technologies but that acts and feels like an app. 

It's important features are:

* to allow users to install web apps to their home screen, 
* to receive push notifications and 
* to even work offline (*try putting your cellphone on airplane mode and re-open the [test live link](https://jainashish.com/test/)*).
